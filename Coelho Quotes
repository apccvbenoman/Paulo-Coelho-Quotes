“You drown not by falling into a river, but by staying submerged in it.”
“You can become blind by seeing each day as a similar one. Each day is a different one, each day brings a miracle of its own. It’s just a matter of paying attention to this miracle.”
“Life has a way of testing a person’s will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen at once.”
“The secret of life is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.”
“You are what you believe yourself to be.”
“Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worst kind of suffering.”
“It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.”

“And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.”
― Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist
