“You can become blind by seeing each day as a similar one. Each day is a different one, each day brings a miracle of its own. It’s just a matter of paying attention to this miracle.”
“Life has a way of testing a person’s will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen at once.”
“The secret of life is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.”
“You are what you believe yourself to be.”
